# GIVEEZY

GIVEEZY is a prototype of a platform that allows donors to create challenges for charities and for helpers to participate in those challenges to raise money for those charities. Currently, the challenges offered are solving LeetCode problems and taking math quizzes. The app doesn't support money transfer yet.

## Features

- Donors can create challenges by specifying the amount of money they will donate to the chosen charity if a certain challenge is completed by a helper.
- Helpers can participate in the challenge by completing the required task and submitting proof of completion.
- Once the challenge is complete, the donor will donate the specified amount of money to the chosen charity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter installed on your local machine

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/justzuka/keti_zuka.git
```

2. Install the dependencies using the following command:
```
flutter pub get
```

3. At this point you can either connect a physical or virtual emulator. Or you can simply open the app in the browser (not the best looking UI in that case):
```
flutter run
```
